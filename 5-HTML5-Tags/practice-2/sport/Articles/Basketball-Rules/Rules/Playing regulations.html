        Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA)[36] or 12 minutes (NBA).[37] College men's games use two
        20-minute halves,[38] college women's games use 10-minute quarters,[39] and most United States high school
        varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state.[40][41] 15 minutes are allowed
        for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules[38][42][43] and 10 minutes in United States high
        schools.[40] Overtime periods are five minutes in length[38][44][45] except for high school, which is four
        minutes in length.[40] Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is actual playing time; the
        clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the
        allotted game time, typically about two hours.
