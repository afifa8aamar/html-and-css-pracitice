        Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is
        widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is.[21][22] When
        Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association
        and during 1978 he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and
        negotiated with each individually; however Ecclestone persuaded the teams to "hunt as a pack" through FOCA.[22]
        He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package, which they could take or leave. In return for the
        package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising. </p>
