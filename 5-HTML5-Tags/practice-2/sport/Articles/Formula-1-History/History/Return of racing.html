        After a hiatus in European motor racing brought about by the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the first World
        Championship for Drivers was won by Italian Giuseppe Farina in his Alfa Romeo in 1950, narrowly defeating his
        Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (His
        record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until German driver Michael Schumacher took his
        sixth title in 2003), his streak interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari.
        Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was never able to win the world championship,
        and is now widely considered to be the greatest driver never to have won the title.[11][12] Fangio, however, is
        remembered for dominating Formula One's first decade and has long been considered the "Grand Master" of Formula
        One.
