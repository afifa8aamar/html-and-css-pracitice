        The first major technological development, Bugatti's re-introduction of mid-engined cars (following Ferdinand
        Porsche's pioneering Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which was unsuccessful. Australian
        Jack Brabham, world champion during 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engined design's superiority. By
        1961, all regular competitors had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design,
        was the last front-engined F1 car to enter a world championship race. It was entered in the 1961 British Grand
        Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.
