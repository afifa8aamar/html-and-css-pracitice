        The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with
        baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets,
        scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.

        A regulation basketball court in international games is 91.9 feet (28.0 meters) long and 49.2 feet (15 meters)
        wide. In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 meters).[35] Most courts have wood flooring,
        usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension.[50][51] The
        name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.
