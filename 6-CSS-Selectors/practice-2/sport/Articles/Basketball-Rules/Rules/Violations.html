        The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or
        dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).

        The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits
        possession. The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is
        out of bounds.

        There are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an
        infraction known as traveling. Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble that
        touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble. Within a
        dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as
        carrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not
        return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of
        possession.

        The ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist. For the offense, a violation of these rules results in
        loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given
        possession of the ball out of bounds.

        There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the
        NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA,
        and U Sports (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding
        the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane,
        (or the "key") (3 seconds). These rules are designed to promote more offense.
