        Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread
        through the United States and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While
        the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the
        new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission. However, other
        amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before World War
        I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of
        the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game. The first pro league, the National Basketball League,
        was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only
        lasted five years.
