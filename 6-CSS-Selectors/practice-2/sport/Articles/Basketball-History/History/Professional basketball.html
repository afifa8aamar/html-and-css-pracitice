        Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and
        cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team
        to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as
        the Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still
        existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.

        In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in
        1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association
        (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest
        in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site
        of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have
        contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished
        many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged
        in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Today the NBA is the top
        professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.

        The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating "big man"; ball-handling
        wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt Chamberlain,
        who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry
        West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers
        John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash; crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley; European
        stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; more recent superstars LeBron James, Allen Iverson and Kobe
        Bryant; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of
        popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and Michael Jordan.

        In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League (later known as the
        NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade). As of the 2018â€“19 season, the G
        League has 27 teams.
