        In early December 1891, Canadian James Naismith,[4] a physical education professor and instructor at the
        International Young Men's Christian Association Training School[5] (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in
        Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor
        game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After
        rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules
        and nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.0 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this
        peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored;
        this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed,[6] allowing the balls to be poked
        out with a long dowel each time.
