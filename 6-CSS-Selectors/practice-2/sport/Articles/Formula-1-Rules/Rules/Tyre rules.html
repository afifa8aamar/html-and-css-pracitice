        The new rule for F1 tyre in 2016 is that the regulations would allow Pirelli to select three different tyres
        for each race, and each team could choose the tyre from those three depending on the strategies. This concept
        would continue in 2017 and in 2018 also but with Pirelli's thicker and wider tyres that tested extensively last
        year.

        Tyre selections are announced over a month before each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce
        compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select
        10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force
        each driver to stick to the same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the new tyre.
