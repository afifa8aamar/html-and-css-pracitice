        The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they
        qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking
        (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided he has not fallen to the back of the
        field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a
        chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their
        equipment from the grid.
